                    <p>Victoria Bevz</p>
                    <p>Born in Odessa, Ukraine, Victoria is a fashion expert and avid chef. Victoria moved with her family to the United States when she was 7. She has had the privilege to attend Brewster Academy, a boarding school in the quaint New England
                        town of Wolfeboro, NH followed by earning a degree in Business from the University of Vermont. While residing in Vermont, Victoria has worked in finance for many years but ultimately her passion is in fashion and vintage design.
                        Victoria is responsible for curating the VIX MARA vintage home division. During her free time Victoria splits her time between Vermont and Palm Beach, Florida. Victoria has traveled around the world to find unique pieces for the
                        home and for recipes she crafts using farm to table ingredients. Victoria is a mother to 9 year old Isabella who follows in her mother’s footsteps. Isabella (or Bella, as everyone knows her by) is a true fashionista whose favorite
                        designer is Lilly Pulitzer and she aspires to be a designer or architect when she grows up. Victoria’s passions include animal rescue (her dog Lilly is a part of our family), as well as being a on the board of trustees on non-profit
                        Angeles Para Honduras, which raises money for less-privileged children to attend school.</p>

                        studies. She has worked in the education field and non profit sector for most of her life. She continues to work in her family’s accounting practice with her father who is a CPA licensed in Florida, Pennsylvania and the commonwealth
                        of Puerto Rico. Marie traveled around the world as a flight attendant with American Airlines and along with her parents, two nephews and their two beloved Maltese dogs. Because of her passion for diversity and other cultures, she
                        has developed a special love for aesthetics, visual art, interior design, architecture, and fashion. Marie and Victoria’s brother share a beautiful lake home in Connecticut. They visit their families in Orlando and Palm Beach often
                        and have traveled together around Florida, New England, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Marie also has special ties with Australia, where she has developed strong friendships and connections in the beauty, fashion and design industries.
                        Marie is known for her love of children, animals, nature, health and fitness. Marie lead’s VIX MARA’s high fashion and interior design lines, focusing on mid century modern and modernist styles.</p>
